# Human Assessment Module
This repository provides the code to support the creation of personalised machine learning models to quantify the cognitive performance and identify stress states, using physiological data. It is organised into four main components:

- **Framework for Experimental Protocol and Data Collection**
- **Personalised Quantification of Cognitive Performance**
- **Personalised Classification of Stress**
- **Real-time Implementation**

## üß™ Framework for Experimental Protocol and Data Collection
The folder `reaction_time_protocol` contains the MATLAB experimental framework used to gather physiological and behavioral data, following the experimental design described in [Rodrigues et al., 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/6/1080).

### Protocol Overview
The experimental session includes the following tests:
- `Baseline`: Participants sit for 10 minutes to establish resting physiological signals.
- `2-Choice Reaction Time Task (CRTT)`: A selective-attention task, where participants identified either the large, global letter or the small, local letters of a hierarchically organized visual object. Their response time and correct/incorrect/missed answers were recorded.
- `Trier Social Stress Test (TSST)`: A validated acute psychosocial stress paradigm involving public speaking and mental arithmetic tasks in front of an evaluative panel.

Order of Tasks:  
`Baseline ‚Üí CRTT1 ‚Üí TSST ‚Üí CRTT2`

Along the protocol, various **psychological self-report scales** were used and their results are saved in the created raw dataset.

### Outputs
The experimental framework collects the following data per participant:
- **ECG:** Raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signal sampled during all protocol phases.
- **VAS:** Self-reported stress level using the Visual Analogue Scale.
- **STAI_6items:** Score from the 6-item short form of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, assessing current anxiety levels.
- **Right_answers:** The correct/expected responses for the CRTT task.
- **Answers:** Participant responses.
- **Answer_reaction_time:** Reaction time (in seconds) for each stimulus in the CRTT task.
- **Answer_timing:** Timestamps indicating when each visual stimulus was presented (used to align with physiological signals).

### Dependencies
*[Psychtoolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/) must be installed and tested before running the visual tasks. Please check Psychtoolbox dependencies at the end*

###  Output Details
- Running the command will generate a model based on the provided dataset.
- Users must enter a unique code to the model when prompted.
- The model will be saved as a `.pkl` file in the `cognition_personalised_models` folder within the working directory. The file will follow this naming convention: `cognition_personalised_models/model_<user_code>.pkl`

### Running the Code
To execute the algorithm, ensure you are in the root directory of the repository. The script should be run using the following command:
```bash
python -m code.personalisation_algorithms.cognition_model_personalisation
```
Upon execution, you will be prompted to select a file containing the dataset. 

‚ö† Attention: The input dataset must follow the required structure, though no example is currently provided, as the data used for testing is private.

## ‚ö°Personalised Classification of Stress
### Input
Each personalised model expects a JSON file as input containing rows of extracted physiological features. The expected structure is the same presented for the cognition performance algorithm. See the "Personalised Quantification of Cognitive Performance" input description for detailed field structure.

###  Output Details
- Running the command will generate a set of models from the provided dataset and a CSV with the performance weights.
- Users must enter a unique code to the model when prompted.
- The outputs will be saved in the `stress_personalised_models/Controller_<user_code>` folder within the working directory. The model files will follow this naming convention: `stress_<model_name>_C<user_code>.pkl`, while the CSV follows:`model_weights_C<user_code>.csv` 

### Running the Code
To execute the algorithm, ensure you are in the root directory of the repository. The script should be run using the following command:
```bash
python -m code.personalisation_algorithms.stress_model_personalisation
```
Upon execution, you will be prompted to select a file containing the dataset. 

‚ö† Attention: The input dataset must follow the required structure, though no example is currently provided, as the data used for testing is private.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Real-time Implementation

The real-time implementation loads personalised cognition and stress models based on a controller_id and applies them to updated physiological feature data, which is read every 60 seconds in a continuous loop.

### Input
On the current code version, an example CSV file: `example_ecg_features.csv` with physiological features is uploaded. The input must include all the ECG features used for "Personalised Quantification of Cognitive Performance":  
- ECG Waveform Features
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Metrics
- Heart Rate Metrics
- Frequency-Domain HRV Metrics

But **should exclude** the `Protocol Variables`, which are only available during training.

‚ö†Ô∏è This should be replaced with a real-time data stream , using the same feature structure as the example CSV.

The appropriate models are automatically selected based on the input controller_id.

### Output details
The script prints:

- Cognition model prediction and explainability results

- Stress model prediction and explainability results

Results are printed to the console in each 60-second cycle.

In the future, the output can be extended to automatically send results to an API endpoint, store them in a database, or feed a real-time dashboard interface.

### Running the Code
To execute the algorithm, ensure you are in the root directory of the repository. The script should be run using the following command:
```bash
python -m code.main
```

## Dependencies
### MATLAB Dependencies (for `reaction_time_protocol`)
- MATLAB R2018a or later
- Psychtoolbox-3
- Signal Processing Toolbox

#### How-to instal os several MATLAB-specific dependencies to run the experimental protocol properly
1. Install Required Libraries (Windows)
Before launching any MATLAB experiments, you must install the following dependencies:

GStreamer (for video/audio handling in Psychtoolbox) - Install both of these:
- gstreamer-1.0-msvc-x86_64-1.26.4
- gstreamer-1.0-devel-msvc-x86_64-1.26.4

After installing, restart your computer or manually add the GStreamer bin/ directory to your Windows system PATH.

Visual C++ Runtimes - Install:

- Visual-C-Runtimes-All-in-One (July 2025)  (or latest version from trusted GitHub source)
    
2. Install Psychtoolbox in MATLAB

After installing the system dependencies, follow these steps inside MATLAB:

```bash
cd('C:\')  % Or your preferred installation folder 
!git clone https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3.git Psychtoolbox 
cd('C:\Psychtoolbox') 
SetupPsychtoolbox 
restoredefaultpath 
addpath(genpath('C:\Psychtoolbox')) 
savepath 
rehash toolboxcache 
clear Screen
```

During SetupPsychtoolbox, accept all prompts to clean the path and finalize setup.

3. Test Psychtoolbox Installation
Run the following in MATLAB to check:

```bash
Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1); 
AssertOpenGL 
w = Screen('OpenWindow', 0, 0);  % A black window should appear 
sca   % Closes the window`
```

If the window opens successfully, your installation is complete.

### Python Dependencies (for model training and real-time inference):
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

Install required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
